This was supposed to be a new tire. \\\\nI took the tire over to Flynn\\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

All of the food was good - the goat cheese pizza in particular with its thin, crispy crust.\\n\\nUnfortunately the day we ate here our service was MIA. We were told we could seat ourselves so we did. After about 10 minutes someone came by to take our drink order and maybe 10 minutes later our waters arrived. Well 2 out of 3 of them did anyway. Then we ordered two salads and two pizzas to share. One pizza came first. WTH? Where were the salads? Or the other pizza? The salads showed up a few minutes later and then our server realized that she had forgotten our second pizza. No biggie since we had salads and one pizza to eat. But the service was lackluster with a L.

       "      <td>Officially my favorite steakhouse hands down!  As if Vegas doesn't have enough to write about, this little gem is in one of the remaining standouts of what some call \\\"Old Vegas\\\".  The meal got off to a great start at the bar as we waited for our table.  The service was fast, the drinks were well made and naturally they were top shelf.  I was particularly pleased with the professional look and feel of the place.  Its very old school, mafioso, dark, white linen, with the sounds of clinking wine glasses and lively conversation in the background.  \\n\\nThe food:  Excellent!  Your steak is served as intended, well aged beef cooked to order on a hot plate...nothing else!  Fantastic.  The sides are of sharable portions so agree on one for every 2 or 3 people unless you plan on toting a box of leftovers around Vegas.  The mac and cheese is perfect as is the smooth and creamy lobster bisque.  The other members in my party had several cuts of meat and one had a chicken dish...my sincerest apologies for not having info on those.  Fact is, I wanted every square inch of space in my belly for the rib eye on my plate.  Like sooo many other reviews about this place, it was melt in your mouth good.  We also ordered a chocolate gnash desert that could only be made better by eating it off of your favorite super models body, otherwise it was absolute perfection.  \\n\\nService was superb.  Our waiter was attentive, informative and practiced.  He was professional and friendly.  Over all a fantastic experience.  I will definitely be returning.  Highly recommend this location to anyone.  You will not be disappointed.</td>\n",
